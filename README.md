# [BoilerCourses](https://www.boiler.courses/)

# Structure
BoilerClasses combines a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with a [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) + [Jooby](https://jooby.io/) backend using [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) to provide an enhanced course catalog. We use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for data (though courses are cached in memory), including posts/reviews.

We use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), specifically Compose, to host our app.

# Future Improvements
We're trying to integrate as many features as possible, and we'll have open issues for the same. If you find a *bug* or have any *feedback*, let us through an [issue](https://github.com/canislupaster/boilercourses/issues) or our [feedback form](https://forms.gle/fZ637w34XCFLtTR76).

# Acknowledgements
Inspired by [classes.wtf](https://classes.wtf) and Purdue's slow course catalogs. We'd like to also thank [Boilerexams](https://boilerexams.com) and [BoilerGrades](https://boilergrades.com/), who we retrieve grade information from.
